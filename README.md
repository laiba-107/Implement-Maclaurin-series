# Implement-Maclaurin-series
This Python script allows users to visualize Maclaurin polynomial approximations for user-defined functions. By entering the function and degree, it plots the original function and its polynomial approximation, aiding in understanding polynomial approximation concepts.

# Usage
Input Function and Degree:

Enter the function f(x) in terms of x.
Specify the degree n of the Maclaurin polynomial.
View Visualization:

The script generates a graph showing the original function and its Maclaurin polynomial approximation.
The degree of the polynomial and the function are displayed for reference.
